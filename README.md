# Understanding SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

This repository contains resources to learn Low Level Design (LLD) / Object Oriented Design (OOD). Whether you are a beginner or looking to reinforce your knowledge, this guide will help you grasp these important concepts that lead to more maintainable, scalable, and robust software.

## Introduction

Welcome to this repository dedicated to understanding the essential concepts of software design: SOLID principles and design patterns.

## SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help developers create more understandable and flexible software systems. Letâ€™s break them down:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.
- **Why It Matters**: By ensuring that classes are focused on a single task, you make your code easier to understand, test, and maintain. If a change is needed, you know exactly where to look.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Why It Matters**: This principle encourages you to write code that can be extended to accommodate new requirements without altering existing code. This helps prevent bugs and maintains stability.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Definition**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Why It Matters**: This principle ensures that a derived class can stand in for a base class. It promotes the use of interfaces and abstractions, leading to more flexible and interchangeable components.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Definition**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **Why It Matters**: This principle suggests creating smaller, specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface. It helps to reduce the impact of changes and promotes more cohesive code.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- **Why It Matters**: This principle encourages decoupling and flexibility in your code. By depending on abstractions, your code becomes less fragile and more adaptable to change.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Here are several key patterns you should know:

### 1. Singleton Pattern
- **Purpose**: Ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for classes that manage shared resources, like a configuration manager or a logger.

### 2. Factory Pattern
- **Purpose**: Create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.
- **Use Case**: Useful when the creation process is complex or when you want to delegate the responsibility of object creation.

### 3. Builder Pattern
- **Purpose**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Use Case**: Great for building complex objects step by step, like constructing a multi-faceted order in an e-commerce system.

### 4. State Pattern
- **Purpose**: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Use Case**: Effective in situations where an object's behavior is dependent on its state, such as an order processing system where the order status can change.

### 5. Observer Pattern
- **Purpose**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used in event handling systems, where multiple components need to be informed of changes in state.

### 6. Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 
- **Use Case**: Useful for applications that need to switch between different algorithms at runtime, such as different pricing strategies for orders.

### 7. Command Pattern
- **Purpose**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for implementing undo/redo functionality in applications where commands need to be executed, undone, or stored.

### 8. Adapter Pattern
- **Purpose**: Allow incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.
- **Use Case**: Useful when integrating with third-party libraries that do not match your existing code structure.
